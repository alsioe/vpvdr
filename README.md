# vpvdr
Analysis and visualisation of VPVD behavioural data and stanfit objects 

This package can be used either to simulate VPVD behaviour based on pre-defined
models and corresponding parameter values (e.g. prior predictive checks) or
used for posterior predictive checks with posterior densities acquired by
(probably) hierarchical Bayesian modelling of choice from a VPVD experiment.

There will also be tools to visualise data in different ways.

Consider this package work in progress - hopefully to be swiftly updated
and useful for users of the valence-probe visual discrimination task!
